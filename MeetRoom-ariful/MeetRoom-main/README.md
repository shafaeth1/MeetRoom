### Technology that are used: 
ReactJS, ReduxJs, Express.js, Node.js, SocketIo, Simple-peer, twilio-node and WebRTC

ReduxJs will be used for all state management.

Socket.IO is an event-driven library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.It provides many more features, including broadcasting to multiple sockets, real-time analytics, binary streaming, instant messaging, and document collaboration.

Simple-peer simplifies WebRTC peer-to-peer data, video, and audio calls streams. data channel

Twilio needs for turn credential because at the end will be connecting our application to the turn server to make sure that most of the connection will be working after our application will be deployed.

WebRTC is an open source project that enables peer-to-peer communication between browsers or the applications.In other words, Bertice allows you to exchange any kind of media for the web, such as video of the data without any required plugin or framework applications which are using properties.

This projects [Live Link](https://meetroom.vercel.app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
